LIB-FastINI
===========
This is a rexx DLL with example rexx code on how any rexx program that accesses INI files through SysIni calls are made much faster. This does not require your code to be rewritten just two small pieces of code to be inserted. It had been seen a 280 times increase in INI update times! While the included example shows one way to incorporate FASTINI code, the recommended approach is to use the FASTINI.XH header file. FastINI Header is a header file and example program on the best way to use my FASTINI.DLL to greatly boost OS/2 rexx's SysIni () performance (hundreds of times faster).
